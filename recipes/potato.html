    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This microwave baked potato recipe is fabled to be delicious and efficient. However, only the brave should attempt it, as the only time the author has attempted a microwave baked potato, it has ended with a smoking microwave. To prevent a fire, the author suggests watching the potato and only microwaving in short intervals.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Microwave safe plate</li>
        <li>Knife</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the potato on a microwave safe plate</li>
        <li>Cut an X into the top of the potato</li>
        <li>Place the plate into the microwave</li>
        <li>Set the microwave for the smallest increment you can tolerate, at least 20 seconds. Continue microwaving in short intervals until the potato looks done. If you are not sure, stop the microwave and check. Hope for the best.</li>
        <li>Stop if the potato starts to smoke, otherwise, enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
